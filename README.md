ALX PRECOURSE

This was created as a exercise during the onboarding into the ALX Software Engineering August Cohort

I had Brackets installed and used it as my test editor.

I had to do a lot of reading and research on GIT. Glad I did. It was really helpful. 

This program is currently in the works and I hope to collaborate with my advancing knowledge on projects soon

It would be nice if any tips can be added
